## Notes

In [](/countries/latvia/#motorcycling), it's legal to ride motorcycles (including mopeds) on public transport lanes, and legally park them on sidewalks (except pedestrian streets) for free.

## Issues

- Marketing is unclear and inconsistent about season start and end dates.
- There is a registration fee, €1.99.
