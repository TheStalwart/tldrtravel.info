## Issues

I could not verify my latvian (+371) phone number but the app seems to work without phone number verification.

Login with Google, Facebook and Apple Account is implemented.

Apple Pay is not supported, only cash and cards via in-app wallet.

Some UI dialogs are broken on both Android and iOS if system language is set to English.
