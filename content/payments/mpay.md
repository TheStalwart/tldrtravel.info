The must-have payment app in [](/countries/poland/).

The app recommends having sticker or note stating “I’m paying with mPay”, but most local vehicles don't have it. These kinds of stickers are usually just free advertisement, as parking controllers use tablets to verify parking payment via vehicle registration numberplate.

## Supported services

- parking
- toll roads
- public transport
- zoo and national park tickets

## Known issues

On iOS, Apple Pay is not supported for direct payments, but in-app wallet can be topped up.

Android version cannot be installed via Play Store if your account country is set to Latvia. I assume it could be sideloaded, but could not verify.

I could not verify Google Pay support, but i assume it works in a similar way to Apple Pay. If you can verify or deny Google Pay support - please reach out via GitHub or any other means of communication.
