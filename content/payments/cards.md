# Cards
Visa/Mastercard Debit/Credit card is a must have for traveling. 

## Suggestions
- Have at least 2x cards from different banks to have a backup if one of the cards is locked out for suspicious activity or payment doesn't go through due to a technical issue like quirky [3-D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) implementation.
- Have push notifications enabled for every transaction.

## American Express
American Express is not accepted everywhere. Have at least one Visa/Mastercard for traveling around Europe. [Why Isn't American Express Accepted at More Places?](https://smartasset.com/credit-cards/american-express-not-accepted). 

## Swedbank
Swedbank is technically a completely different bank in every country
- {{% payment-link "swish" %}} will not work with e.g. Latvian Swedbank account
- Trying to pay for Lithuanian event ticket with Latvian Swedbank account can be declined with "account does not exist" error when using Swedbank Bank Link. If payment processor does not allow choosing Swedbank country - enter Visa/Mastercard card number instead of using Bank Link, or use a different bank that doesn't have these kinds of quirks.
