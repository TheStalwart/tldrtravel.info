The official app of public transport operator in Riga, [](/countries/latvia/).

It's slow and buggy, i suggest using Google Maps for route planning and {{% payment-link "mobilly" %}} to buy tickets.

The only reasons you would want to have this app are also available on the web, without registration and local phone number requirements:

- [detailed public transport schedule](https://saraksti.lv/#/en)
- real time map of public transport
  - [in latvian](https://saraksti.lv/#riga/map)
  - [in english](https://saraksti.lv/#riga/map/en) (broken localization as of March 2025)

## Supported services

- public transport

## Known issues

To use the app, [Estonian](/countries/estonia/), [Latvian](/countries/latvia/) or [Lithuanian](/countries/lithuania/) phone number is _required_. Foreign phone numbers are not supported.

In iOS version, iCloud Keychain support is broken, the app freezes if you try to generate a new secure password.
