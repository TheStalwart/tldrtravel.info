# Cash

It's good to always have some amount of cash for tipping and as a backup.

## Currencies

In eurozone countries that still use local currencies, it's often possible to pay with euro cash. I did not use any PLN and SEK cash in my 2022-2023 trips.

## Germany

Just a few years ago i had multiple encounters of businesses that only accept {{% payment-link "cards" %}} issued by German banks. My last trip in 2023 was mostly cashless, but you never know because [](/countries/germany).
