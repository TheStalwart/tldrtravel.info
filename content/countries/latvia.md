- It's legal to ride motorcycles on public transport lanes

- The only protective gear legally required is helmet. Helmet certification is not required, unlike in [Italy]({{< ref "/countries/italy#motorcycling" >}})
- There are no major exceptions for low-cc mopeds except legal age requirement. Unlike in [France]({{< ref "/countries/france#motorcycling" >}}), you must have a driver's license, helmet and insurance to ride 49cc scooters!
- Read [Road Traffic Regulations](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/274865-road-traffic-regulations) and [Road Traffic Law](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/45467-road-traffic-law) for more details

Had great experience renting a motorcycle from [L-auto](https://l-auto.lv/lv) - all kinds of motorcycles and also protective gear is available for reasonable price.
