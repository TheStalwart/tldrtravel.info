## Must-have app
[App - eVeselÄ«basPunkts (eveselibaspunkts.lv)](https://eveselibaspunkts.lv/en/App) allows user to make an emergency call to 113 by simultaneously transmitting caller location data (GPS coordinates) and basic information of caller to Emergency medical service dispatchers.

## Motorcycling
- It's legal to ride the following with a car license (B category):
	- <=125cc motorcycles 
	- [3-wheeled motorcycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaggio_MP3) irregardless of engine capacity, if rider is at least 21 years old.
- It's legal to ride motorcycles on public transport lanes
- It's legal to park 2-wheeled motorcycles on sidewalks (except pedestrian streets) for free
- The only protective gear legally required is helmet. Helmet certification is not required, unlike in [Italy]({{< ref "/countries/Italy#motorcycling" >}})
- There are no major exceptions for low-cc mopeds except legal age requirement. Unlike in [France]({{< ref "/countries/france#motorcycling" >}}), you must have a driver's license, helmet and insurance to ride 49cc scooters!
- Read [Road Traffic Regulations](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/274865-road-traffic-regulations) and [Road Traffic Law](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/45467-road-traffic-law) for more details

Had great experience renting a motorcycle from [L-auto](https://l-auto.lv/lv) - all kinds of motorcycles and also protective gear is available for reasonable price.
