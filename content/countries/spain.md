## Driving

Payment for specific highways is implemented via cash/card/transponder at toll booths. Prepaid vignettes are not required.

## Motorcycling

Motorcycling is highly regulated in Spain. Make sure to read the law, and not _assume_ your rights.

You must carry a hi-viz jacket ready to wear on the highways in case of breakdown.

Helmet must be compliant with ECE 22.05 standard. Use of non-homologated intercoms is illegal. Fiddling with intercom buttons while riding is illegal.

National law forbids motorcycling on roads that are narrower than 4 meters. Even if you stay within premade routes like TET and ACT, make sure to comply with [group riding limits and forest fire warnings during summer months](https://thespanishbiker.wordpress.com/survival/the-law/regional-rules-for-trail-riding/).
