## Taxi

[Uber-like taxi apps are banned in Bulgaria](https://sofiaglobe.com/2015/10/06/uber-suspends-services-in-bulgaria/), because [legacy taxi companies were complaining](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/resources/article/2016/bulgaria-supreme-court-shuts-down-smartphone-car-service-uber).

## Driving

A valid vignette is required for cars and trucks to access motorways and most lower-class roads. Buy it at [National Toll Administration](https://www.bgtoll.bg/en/).

## Motorcycling

Motorcycles are exempt from vignette requirement.
