## Driving

Cars and trucks must [buy a vignette](https://www.roviniete.ro/en/rovinieta) to access motorways and state roads.

## Motorcycling

Motorcycles are exempt from vignette requirement.

Some locals will tell you about the requirement for motorcyclists to carry a fire extinguisher. This was true until 2024, but is [no longer required](https://www.femamotorcycling.eu/romania-fireextinguisher/).
