## Driving

All vehicles with four wheels and a maximum weight of 3.5 tons have an obligation to purchase an electronic vignette. The system is fully digital and automated via license plate scanning, vignette is purchased for a particular vehicle numberplate. See [eDalnice website](https://edalnice.cz/en/) for more information.

## Motorcycling

Motorcycles are exempt from vignette requirement. No need to register or purchase any vignettes. However, my latvian motorcycle's numberplate is validated with "Invalid" state - this seems to be a software bug.

Car driving license (B category) only allows riding <=125cc bikes that have automatic transmission. For 125cc manual gearbox motorcycle you will need explicit A1 license.[^1]
