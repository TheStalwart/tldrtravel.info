## Driving

There are toll motorways in Serbia, and all motorcycles and cars need to pay to use them. Payment system is similar to [](/countries/italy/#driving) - queue up to a gate with "human in a window" sign, take a card, then, when exiting the motorway, pay with card or cash. Do _NOT_ use gates that only have "ENP" sign. Toll amount [depends on distance traveled and kind of the vehicle](https://www.putevi-srbije.rs/index.php/en/kategorizacija-vozila-cenovnik-putarine-2).
