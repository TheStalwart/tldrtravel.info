## Parking app

- {{% payment-link "mpay" %}} - sticker or note stating "I'm paying with mPay" is recommended

## Driving

There are toll motorways in Poland, and all motorcycles and cars need to pay to enter them. Unlike [](/countries/italy/#driving), toll booths are clearly marked - queue up to a gate with "human in a window" sign, pay with card or cash and enter the motorway.
