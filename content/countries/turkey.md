## Accommodation

[Booking.com](https://booking.com) is degraded in Turkey. [Locations in Turkey are not available for Booking from inside the country](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293974-i368-k14656805-o10-Website_blocked_in_Turkey-Istanbul.html). Some travelers on Facebook report bypassing the restriction is trivial using a VPN with exit node abroad.

## Communication

Government [banned Discord](https://www.reuters.com/technology/turkey-blocks-instant-messaging-platform-discord-2024-10-09/), and other [popular websites and messaging services are being blocked and unblocked](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Access-to-various-internet-platforms-in-Turkey-restricted-10322021.html) randomly.

[Popular VPN services are blocked](https://stockholmcf.org/turkey-blocks-access-to-27-popular-vpn-services-amid-tightening-internet-restrictions/) as well, so a custom VPN solution like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is recommended.
