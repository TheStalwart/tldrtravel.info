## Features
- One-time visit price: 
    - trial: 3 EUR
    - regular: 13-15 EUR
- Free parking (in most clubs)
- Free locker lock with every new contract (questionable value!)
- Very clean
- Sauna
- Spa (in select clubs)

## Issues
- No 24/7 access
- No free trial
- Cash only accepted in select clubs
- Unclear price list
- Predatory subscription policy
- Subscriptions are per-country, having other country's subscription only grants a discount

## Extra notes
- Low cost 24/7 offering by the same holding is called {{% gym-link "gym-latvija" %}}[^1]
- Lithuanian {{% gym-link "gymplius" %}} chain is owned by MyFitness[^2], but offers and pricing is quite different.
