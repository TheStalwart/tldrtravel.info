# Forus
Alternative to {{% transportation-link "bolt" %}}, that is sometimes cheaper, but there are _many_ 1-star reviews in the App Store for both technical issues and bad quality of service. Admittedly, {{% transportation-link "bolt" %}} has as many 1-star reviews, but unlike Forus, they also have >25000 positive reviews, while price difference for an average urban taxi ride is usually just a couple Euro.
